🔍 **Problem Description**:
<!-- Provide a concise and clear description of the problem or use case that the model aims to address. Explain why this problem needs a solution. -->

🧠 **Model Description**:
<!-- Describe the underlying model you plan to use, such as Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks. Include any important technical details about the model, such as key algorithms or techniques involved, and why this model is appropriate for solving the problem. -->

⏲️ **Estimated Time for Completion**:
<!-- Provide an estimate of the time you expect it will take to fully implement and test the model. -->

🎯 **Expected Outcome**:
<!-- Clearly describe what the expected outcome will be after the model is implemented. Highlight the impact on functionality, performance, or other metrics that will be improved as a result of this addition. -->

📄 **Additional Context**:
<!-- Include any extra information or context. -->

**To be Mentioned while taking the issue**:
- What is your participant role? <!-- (Mention the Open Source Program name. Eg. GSSOC, SSOC, Hacktoberfest, etc.) -->

**Note:**
- Please review the project documentation and ensure your code aligns with the project structure.
- Please ensure that either the `predict.py` file includes a properly implemented `model_details()` function or the notebook contains this function to print a detailed model report. The model will not be accepted without this function in place, as it is essential for generating the necessary model details.
- Prefer using a new branch to resolve the issue, as it helps keep the main branch stable and makes it easier to manage and review your changes.
- Strictly use the pull request template provided in the repository to create a pull request.
